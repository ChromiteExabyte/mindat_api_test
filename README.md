## What is this repository?

An open-source effort to add a GUI using Tkinter. Hopefully it can work and be helpful ! 

Right now, there is only a skeleton GUI around existing code for the API by Ryan Hamel. 

A separate .py file has been created to handle uploading keys. 

The original API test .py by Jolyon Ralph is in this repository.
