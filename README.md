Unofficial attempt at GUI implementation with tkinter for the Mindat API and maybe some helpful aysnc snippets for further use. 


This repository is not officially associated with Mindat or OpenMindat. The project is wonderful and complex.  Official links here:

**A simple python example for the (alpha) version of the API. Requires an API key**

## What is this repository?

An open-source effort. Hopefully it can work and be helpful ! 

Right now, there is only a skeleton GUI around existing code. There are extra async functions added that I do not understand just yet. Most of the work there for the API bits are by Ryan Hamel. 

A separate .py file has been created to handle uploading keys. It does not work. 

The original API test .py by Jolyon Ralph is in this repository for the old Mindat server I believe.
